# Prediction of Russian ruble (RUB) against US dollar (USD) in June 2022 amid Russian-Ukrainian war

## General information 
***Objective #1: EVALUATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OIL PRICE IN PREDICTING THE USD/RUB RATE.***

Among many other factors that define the exchange rate of USD/RUB, such as inflation rate, interest rate,, and government debt, we wanted to evaluate the extent to which the oil price affects the USD/RUB rate. 

***Objective #2: PREDICTION OF USD/RUB AVERAGE IN JUNE 2022.***

Using different models, we aimed to predict the average exchange rate of USD/RUB in June 2022 as such prediction is valuable for financial decision-making of individuals and organizations. 

## Methodology
***Step 1: EXPLORATORY  DATA  ANALYSIS*** 

EDA showed that after the devaluation of the ruble followed by  Russiaâ€™s first invasion of Ukraine in February 2014, the rate of change of USD/RUB only stabilized in early 2018

***Step 2: SPLITTING DATA TO TRAINING AND TESTING SETS***

Data was split from 12-2003 to 02-2018 and from 03-2018 to 05-2022 for training and testing sets respectively (77/23 ratio.) 

***Step 3:  LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL***

Linear Regression models were built using different combinations of features.

***Step 4:  KERAS DEEP LEARNING MODEL***

Keras Deep Learning models were built using different combinations of features.
